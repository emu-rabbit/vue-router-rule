# Vue Router Rule

![Unicorn](https://github.com/emu-rabbit/vue-router-rule/blob/3405bcf659142c114504ea1eb5d7b14d15d2a939/vuepress/src/.vuepress/public/images/unicorn.png)

Vue Router Rule is an addon for [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/).  
For complex router navigation rules (especially those involving authorization and business needs), the guard [beforeEach](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html#global-before-guards) can become unwieldy, unreadable, and difficult to debug or maintain.  
This addon provides an alternative way to define rules that are more readable and maintainable.
