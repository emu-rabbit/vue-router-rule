# Vue Router Rule

Vue Router Rule is a [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) addon.  
For some complex router navigation rules (usually with authorization, business needed), the guard [beforeEach](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html#global-before-guards) become huge, unreadable and hard to debug or maintains.  
This addon provide another way to define rules for more readable and maintainable coding.
